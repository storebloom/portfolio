# Top Story

Top Story is a plugin that creates a static content box at the
bottom of all single post article pages.  This by default
displays the newest post including author and timestamp information.

Built in to this plugin is a settings page used for manually
assigning any post as the current "Top Story".

The option page can be found in the dashboard menu under
Settings > Top Story.

Here you will be able to search for posts by title and 
select the post you wish to use as the current Top Story.

If you do not wish to manually replace the newest story then
simply leave the option field blank.
